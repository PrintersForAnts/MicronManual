# Introduction

#### STL File Key

The STL naming convention used for Micron is below:

| Primary Color                                               | Accent Color                                                                                                       | Quantity Required                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Example                                                     | Example                                                                                                            | Example                                                                                                     |
| z_drive_main_a_x2.stl                                       | \[a\]\_z_drive_baseplate_a_x2.stl                                                                                  | \[a\]\_z_drive_baseplate_a_x2.stl                                                                           |
| These files will have nothing at the start of the filename. | These files will have ‘’\[a\]’’ to the front to mention that they are intended to be printed with an accent color. | If a file ends with ‘’\_x#’’, that is telling you the quantity of that part required to build this system.. |
